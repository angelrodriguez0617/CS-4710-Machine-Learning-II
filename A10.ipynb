    "The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) was solved for a set of 4 cities using a brute force method. All possible tours were generated and the total distance for each tour was calculated. The optimal tour, which is the tour with the shortest total distance, was found to be (0, 1, 3, 2). This means that the salesman starts at city 0, then travels to city 1, then to city 3, then to city 2, and finally returns to city 0. The total distance of this tour is 45, which is the shortest possible distance that the salesman can travel to visit all cities once and return to the starting city. This result effectively solves the TSP for this particular set of cities and distances."
